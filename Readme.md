The username, password and hostname is saved LOCALLY ONLY in a text file with no encryption.
You can manually access this by going into the "Creds.txt" file.

If for some reason you cannot login try choosing option 3 and entering your credentials again, this will reset the "Creds.txt" file and may solve your problem.
